    <h3>The Uskok class was a class of two motor torpedo boats, Uskok and Četnik, built for the Royal Yugoslav Navy.
        Laid
        down on 15 September 1926 and launched in May 1927, they were lightly built using mahogany and powered by two
        petrol
        engines. Their main armament was <a href="https://artcenter.instructure.com/">two British-designed</a> 456 mm (18 in) torpedoes.</h3>
    <p>They were also fitted with hydrophones and could carry depth charges instead of torpedoes if used in an
        anti-submarine role. When the Axis invaded Yugoslavia in April 1941, Italian forces captured both boats.
        Commissioned in the Royal Italian Navy, the boats operated out of the Dalmatian port of Šibenik, their pre-war
        base. Their aged condition meant they were only used for patrolling and second-line duties. Uskok sank near the
        Dalmatian island of Mljet in July 1942 when its hull failed. </p>
